# Text Analyzer

This project is a text analyzer based on the Django framework. It filters text input by removing punctuation, extra spaces, and new lines. It also capitalizes the text to enhance readability and provide a clean output.

## Features

- Removes punctuation: The text analyzer filters out punctuation marks from the input text, allowing you to focus solely on the content.

- Eliminates extra spaces: It removes any additional spaces present within the text, ensuring a consistent and uniform presentation.
